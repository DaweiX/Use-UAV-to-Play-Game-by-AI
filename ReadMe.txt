All the codes in this file have a declare of author.
MCTS part is based on a work on GitHub:Mento-Carlo-Tree-Search
All the assets of this software is made by DaweiX. Except for the
file 'X.png' (source:https://www.58pic.com/piccate/11-0-0.html?tid=7612)
The files in the 'Others' folder contains some extra files or works made by me.
All the UI files (.xaml) in the folder 'Views', is designed by DaweiX.

NOTE: If we meet a problem when generate the project which says we need to deploy
the project 'DJIVideoParser' at first, just remove this project from the root project.
Anyway, I think the best way to try to run this program is to copy all the codes (don't
forget App.xaml.cs) to a new C# UWP project.
